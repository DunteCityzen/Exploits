# Exploits

These repository contains exploits that I find helpful in the wild. In my very young journey as a pentester(2024) I have realized that sometimes you'll meet an exploit online and due to one issue or another using it or even getting it ready for use being a nightmare. We'll I'm not that a regular publisher of content but rest be assured that whenever I find something hard to use or compile out there and somehow I manage to get it to work(compiled etc), be sure to find it posted here.
